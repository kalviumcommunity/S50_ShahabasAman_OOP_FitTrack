# FitTrack - Personal Fitness Tracker

## Overview
The Personal Fitness Tracker is a console-based application designed to help users track their fitness activities and goals.

## Features
- **User Profile Management**: Create and manage user profiles with details like name, age, weight, and fitness goals.
- **Activity Tracking**: Log various fitness activities such as running, cycling, weightlifting, etc., including details like duration, distance, sets, reps, etc.

- **Calorie Counter**: Calculate and track calories burned during activities based on user input or predefined metrics.
- **Data Persistence**: Store user profiles, activity logs, and progress data persistently using file handling or a simple database.

## Object-Oriented Design
- **Classes**: Define classes such as `User`, `Activity`, `Goal`, etc., to encapsulate data and methods related to each entity.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Utilize inheritance for specialized activities (e.g., `Running`, `Weightlifting`) derived from a base `Activity` class.
- **Encapsulation**: Ensure data privacy by using private, protected, and public access modifiers appropriately.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract common functionalities into base classes or interfaces to promote code reusability and maintainability.

## Implementation Details
- **Technologies**: Implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming principles.
- **Dependencies**: Minimal dependencies, primarily standard C++ libraries.
- **Build Instructions**: Provide steps to compile and run the application on various platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).
